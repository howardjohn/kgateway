                            FieldDefault provides default values for specific fields in the JSON request body sent to the LLM provider.
                            These defaults are merged with the user-provided request to ensure missing fields are populated.

                            User input fields here refer to the fields in the JSON request body that a client sends when making a request to the LLM provider.
                            Defaults set here do _not_ override those user-provided values unless you explicitly set `override` to `true`.

                            Example: Setting a default system field for Anthropic, which does not support system role messages:
                            ```yaml
                            defaults:
                              - field: "system"
                                value: "answer all questions in French"

                            ```

                            Example: Setting a default temperature and overriding `max_tokens`:
                            ```yaml
                            defaults:
                              - field: "temperature"
                                value: "0.5"
                              - field: "max_tokens"
                                value: "100"
                                override: true

                            ```

                            Example: Setting custom lists fields:
                            ```yaml
                            defaults:
                              - field: "custom_integer_list"
                                value: "[1,2,3]"
                              - field: "custom_string_list"

                            ```

                                            Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                            case-insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).

                                            If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                            entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                            entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                            case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                            equivalent.

                                            When a header is repeated in an HTTP request, it is
                                            implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented.
                                            Generally, proxies should follow the guidance from the RFC:

                          Method names are case sensitive, so these values are also case-sensitive.

                          When the `AllowMethods` field is configured with one or more methods, the

                            DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                            `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                            left of its position.
                          * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

                          An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                          from all `Origin`s are allowed.

                          When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                          means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                          `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                          the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                          client.

                          The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                          always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

                          If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                          the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                          cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                          403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                          the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                          Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

                          The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                          wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                          When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowOrigins` field
                          specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                          in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                          instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                          the client.

                          to client-side scripts in response to a cross-origin request.

                          A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                          that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                          The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
                          `Cache-Control`
                          `Content-Language`
                          `Content-Length`
                          `Content-Type`
                          `Expires`
                          `Last-Modified`
                          `Pragma`
                          (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-response-header-name)
                          The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.

                          When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
                          this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
                          client.

                          Header names are not case sensitive.

                          Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
                          response header are separated by a comma (",").

                          A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
                          to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
                          use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                          which value is present in the `AllowHeaders` field.

                          If any header name in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header
                          is not included in the list of header names specified by the response
                          header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, it will present an error on the

                          If any header name in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
                          does not recognize by the client, it will also occur an error on the

                          are specified in the `AllowMethods` field.

                          When the `AllowMethods` field is configured with one or more methods, the
                          gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header

                          AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
                          resource from the given `Origin`.

                          The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
                          takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.

                          Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.

                          Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
                          available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
                          assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
                          origins. This may affect origin matching.

                          The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
                          wildcard characters behave as follows:

                          * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                            DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                            `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                            left of its position.
                          * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

                          An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                          from all `Origin`s are allowed.

                          When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                          means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                          `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                          the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                          client.

                          The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                          always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

                          If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                          the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                          cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                          403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                          the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                          Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

                          The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                          wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                          When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowOrigins` field
                          specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                          in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                          instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                          the client.

              ancestors:
                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.

                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                            boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                            routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                            any namespace to the Service.

                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                            "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                            connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                            the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                            ParentRef of the Route.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

                        Notes for implementors:

                        Conditions are a listType `map`, which means that they function like a
                        map with a key of the `type` field _in the k8s apiserver_.

                        This means that implementations must obey some rules when updating this
                        section.

                        * Implementations MUST perform a read-modify-write cycle on this field
                          before modifying it. That is, when modifying this field, implementations
                          must be confident they have fetched the most recent version of this field,
                          and ensure that changes they make are on that recent version.
                        * Implementations MUST NOT remove or reorder Conditions that they are not
                          directly responsible for. For example, if an implementation sees a Condition
                          with type `special.io/SomeField`, it MUST NOT remove, change or update that
                          Condition.
                        * Implementations MUST always _merge_ changes into Conditions of the same Type,
                          rather than creating more than one Condition of the same Type.
                        * Implementations MUST always update the `observedGeneration` field of the
                          Condition to the `metadata.generation` of the Gateway at the time of update creation.
                        * If the `observedGeneration` of a Condition is _greater than_ the value the
                          implementation knows about, then it MUST NOT perform the update on that Condition,
                          but must wait for a future reconciliation and status update. (The assumption is that
                          the implementation's copy of the object is stale and an update will be re-triggered
                          if relevant.)

                              lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                              This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                              with respect to the current state of the instance.

                        longer necessary.
